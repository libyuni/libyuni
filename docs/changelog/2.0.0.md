libyuni - release v2.0.0
========================


New
---

 * **{core}** added System::Environment::ReadAsUInt64()
 * **{core}** added System::Environment::Exists() to test if a variable is defined
 * **{core}** added System::Environment::Unset() to remove an environment variable
 * **{core}** added System::Environment::Set() to define environment variables
 * **{core}** added Flags<T>, a space-efficient set of flags from an enum class
 * **{core}** added String::swap()
 * **{core}** added `String::blank()`, to get if empty string or only whitespaces
 * **{core}** added `YUNI_ATTR_NODISCARD`, to warn when the return value is not used (see [[nodiscard]])
 * **{core}** added `YUNI_OS_DRAGONFLY`, when libyuni is compiled on DragonFly
 * **{core}** added `String::forgetContent()`, to take ownership of the internal storage
 * **{parser}** added `Node::append` to easily append a new node
 * **{job}** added `IJob::uncaughtException`, when an unknown exception is emitted when a job is executed

Changed
-------

 * **{core}** `DynamicLibrary::File` now uses enum class for the relocation type
   and the visibility scope (ex: `relocationLazy` -> `DynamicLibrary::Relocation::lazy`)
 * **{jobs}** `State` is now an enum class
 * **{jobs}** `Priority` is now an enum class (`priorityDefault` has been renamed to `Priority::normal`)
 * **{parser}** The generated code now relies on C++14 features
 * **{parser}** Fixed parsing on empty files
 * **{core}** Version: the attribute `revision` has been renamed to `patch`, to reflect the definition
   of semantic versioning. A new field `metadata` has been added as well.
 * **{uuid}** UUID now uses CoreFoundation on macOS
 * **{uuid}** UUID::Flag is now a enum class (`UUID::fGenerate` becomes `UUID::Flag::generate` for example)
 * Minimum version of cmake is now 3.2

Removed
-------

 * **{core}**: Removed `Yuni::Variant` which suffers from too many design flaws. A new implementation
   will replace it later.
 * **{core}**: Removed `Yuni::Any` for the same reasons

Fixes
-----

 * **{core}** System::Environment::ReadAsInt64 now properly returns the
   default value if failed to convert to an int64
 * **{core}** Fixed constness for SmartPtr::WeakPointer functions
 * **{core}** Fixed invalid MD5 digest for empty inputs
 * **{core}** Propagate arguments when executing a program (Windows only)

 * **{parser}** Added missing escaped characters \r and \t when printing the AST
